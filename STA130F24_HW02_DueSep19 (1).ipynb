But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "> _As you may or may not have already experienced in the previous problem, a ChatBot applied to this problem is likely to start explaining a bit more knowledge about Python than you need to know (as a student just trying to learn stats+DS); however, you'll probably feel like this \"out of scope\" context information is helpful to know (or at least be aware of) and easy to understand and learn if you use some addtional prompts to dig deeper into them. A ChatBot will be quite good at explaining and helping understand smaller chunks of code; however, if given too much information at once it can gloss over some information._\n",

    "> _That said, some topics here are potentially quite and advanced and too tricky! You might be able to ask the ChatBot to simplify its explanations and that might help a bit. But on the other hand, some topics, such as, \"how does `nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)` work?\" might just simply be too advanced to really admit a simpler explanation via a ChatBot. You'll have to let these sorts of things go, if you come across explanations that just aren't improving or helping at at. In the case of `defaultdict(nested_dict)` specifically, the details here are well beyond the scope of STA130 and can be very safely ignored for now. The code will have reviewed and \"walked thorugh\" in LEC, but the perspectives espoused there will be the extent of the formal commentary and information regarding the coding topics we encounter in the Markov ChatBots code here._\n",
